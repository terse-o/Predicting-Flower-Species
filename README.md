# Predicting-Flower-Species
Used Naive Bayes Classifier to predict the species of flowers.

Language: R 

Editor: RStudio (v1.2.1335)

Description: Used Naive Bayes Classifier to predict the species of flowers.

NOTE:
For the model of predicting flower species in-built dataset called 'iris' was used from RStudio.

PREDICTING FLOWER SPECIES:

-Load data

-Split dataset into train and test set

-Apply Naive Bayes on train set

-Predict species from test set using trained model

-Check the accuracy by creating a table for actual and predicted species
